Medium

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
 
Example 1:
 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
Example 2:
Input: head = []
Output: []
Example 3:
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100
