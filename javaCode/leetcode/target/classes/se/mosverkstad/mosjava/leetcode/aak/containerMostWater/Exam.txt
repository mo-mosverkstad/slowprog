[LeetCode] 11. Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container and nis at least 2.
 
The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
 
Example:
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

Example:
Input: [1,1]
Output: 1

Example:
Input: [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16

Example:
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 2
