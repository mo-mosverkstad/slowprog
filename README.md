# SLOW PROG
It is my first repository to record and retrospect my python programming practices in the first year when I started to dabble programming (2016-Nov to 2017-Nov).

In this repository, the file structure is as following:
```
src                           // all of the python source coding files which have been implement by me.
    +-- 01.caesar_cypher      // the code naming as <sequence number, e.g. 01, 02>.<coding topic with underscore connect>
        +-- caesar_cypher.a1  // the code naming as <coding topic>.<two-character-version, first is letter and second is digit>
        +-- caesar_cypher.a2  // digit in version reflects small changes, e.g. variable or function names change
        +-- caesar_cypher.b1  // letter in version reflects big changes, e.g. architecture affects
    +-- 02.reversed_cypher
    ...
    ...
javaCode
    +-- leetcode  //Java code implementation to leetcode exercise.
README.md // readme

The details about my codings, ideas, lessons learnt and stories, can be found in the wiki of this repository.
